## Meal Plan

One of the amazing benefits of being a Connect Moar Camper is that you're part of the meal program.  <br />
Everyone gets a dinner prepared nightly by the OUTSTANDING kitchen team!
<br />
The team is looking to start prep so that meals are served a bit before dusk so that they're still able to practice Safety Third Principles! 
and so they also get to all head out and have a fun evening as well.   We'll discuss specifics on Playa during the Mandatory all-camp meeting.
<br />
The current 2023 menu plan is:
* Monday - Stroganoff w/ broccoli over noodles.  Mushroom base, with optional thin sliced sous vide tri tip
* Tuesday - Taco night. (Shredded pork and mushroom)
* Wednesday - Curry night  (roti, paneer, chicken)
* Thursday - Chili night (white bean chicken or veggie red)
* Friday - Grilled cheese (pulled pork & tomato w/ boirson) (soup)
* Saturday - Bolognese w/ garlic bread (arrabiata for vegetarians) served over noodles
